## üåê API Endpoints

This project includes one REST controller named `HelloWorldController` with two GET endpoints.

1. **Endpoint: `/HelloWorld`**  
   - Receives a query parameter `name` (optional, default = `UNKNOWN`).
   - **Response**: Returns a greeting in the format `Hola, [name]. You are running a Gradle project.`.

   **Examples**:
   - Default: `http://localhost:9001/HelloWorld` ‚Üí Response: `Hola, UNKNOWN. You are running a Gradle project.`
   - With name: `http://localhost:9001/HelloWorld?name=John` ‚Üí Response: `Hola, John. You are running a Gradle project.`

2. **Endpoint: `/HelloWorld2`**  
   - Receives a path variable `name`.
   - **Response**: Returns a greeting in the format `Hola, [name]. You are running a Gradle project.`.

   **Examples**:
   - Default: `http://localhost:9001/HelloWorld2/UNKNOWN` ‚Üí Response: `Hola, UNKNOWN. You are running a Gradle project.`
   - With name: `http://localhost:9001/HelloWorld2/John` ‚Üí Response: `Hola, John. You are running a Gradle project.`
